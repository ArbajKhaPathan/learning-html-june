    <h3>HISTORY - TIPU SULTAN</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Tipu Sultan (born December 1, 1751, Devanhalli [now Bengaluru, India]—died May 4, 1799, Seringapatam [now Srirangapatna]) was the sultan (king) of the Kingdom of Mysore, who reigned from December 1782 until his death in 1799. He is known for the four<mark>Anglo-Mysore</mark> Anglo-Mysore Wars of the late 18th century in which he fought against Britain and its allies. There are differing theories on why Tipu is called the “Tiger of Mysore,” such as a legend that he killed a tiger with a dagger, his use of a tiger on his insignia, and the fact that he displayed exceptional war tactics and ferocity in battle, particularly against the British.
